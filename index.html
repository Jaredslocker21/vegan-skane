                    Thank you so much for visiting THE VEGAN OPTION. As we all know <bold>The Vegan Option</bold> on
                    menus around the world have been making a bold statement.
                    There has been a multi billion-dollar investment into how food culture has changed and how people
                    engage with restaurants. Everyone has that one friend
                    who is a Vegan for one reason or another. So we are going to help you find the Meals around Skåne
                    Sweden that give you that option. The Vegan Option!

                <hr>
                <p>Two Monkeys is a staple to Malmö where everyone wether you are Vegan or non Vegan can enjoy a
                    handsome burger, wrap or Bowl. They are located at the Emporia Mall. Don't be fooled by being in a mall. Their food packs a lot of flavor.
